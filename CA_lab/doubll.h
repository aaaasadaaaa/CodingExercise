 Header file for a doubly linked list.
 An empty list has NULL pointers for first and last.
 items is a counter for the total numbers of items in the list.
 bytes is a counter for the total size in the list.

 A list item (doubll_item) has a pointer to the previous and next items (NULL if non-existent). 
 It also has a pointer to the data (owned by the list item) and the size of that data.
