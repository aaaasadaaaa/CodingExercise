You are free to choose NOT to use it.
Because may have wrong standard output  

1.COPY YOUR makefile calendar in this folder
2.and run ./test.sh

the input folder : random inputs
the output folder : "standard" output
the YourOut folder : your fancy output
4 cases in each folders and 100 random testcases for each case

test.sh will check out your outputs and the ones in output folder

You can copy the calendar you trust in this folder and run ./gen.sh to get new standard output
You may wait for several seconds to generate 100 new standard output for each case

goodluck. hope you will AC ASAP.
